<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Prosthetic Heart Valve/ Artificial Heart Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transcatheter Heart Valve</li><li>Tissue Heart Valve</li><li>Mechanical Heart Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The prosthetic heart valve market is divided into three main types: transcatheter heart valve, tissue heart valve, and mechanical heart valve. Transcatheter heart valves are implanted through a minimally invasive procedure, offering a less invasive option for patients. Tissue heart valves are made from animal or human tissue and are more durable than mechanical valves. Mechanical heart valves are made from synthetic materials and offer long-term durability but require patients to take blood-thinning medications. Each type of valve offers unique benefits and considerations for patients.</p></p>

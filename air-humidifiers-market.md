<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Humidifiers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vapor Type Air Humidifiers</li><li>Water Spray Air Humidifiers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air humidifiers come in two main types: vapor type and water spray type. Vapor type air humidifiers use a heating element to create steam, which is then released into the air to increase humidity levels. On the other hand, water spray air humidifiers work by spraying a fine mist of water into the air, which evaporates and increases humidity. Both types are effective at adding moisture to the air, but vapor type humidifiers are generally more efficient and better suited for larger spaces.</p></p>

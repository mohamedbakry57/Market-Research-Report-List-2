<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photosensitive Polyimide Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photosensitive Polyimide</li><li>Negative Photosensitive Polyimide</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photosensitive polyimide coatings are widely used in electronics and semiconductor industries. Positive photosensitive polyimide coatings are exposed to UV light through a mask, which creates a pattern allowing for selective removal of the coating during development. This type of coating is commonly used for creating printed circuit boards. On the other hand, negative photosensitive polyimide coatings become insoluble in areas exposed to UV light, making them suitable for applications where high precision and intricate patterns are required, such as in semiconductor manufacturing.</p></p>

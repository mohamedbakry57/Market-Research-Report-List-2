<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AFM-Raman Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spectral Resolution ≤0.5cm-1</li><li>Spectral Resolution ≤1cm-1</li></ul></p>
<p><p>AFM-Raman systems with spectral resolution of ≤0.5 cm-1 are typically used in advanced research applications where high precision and accuracy are required, such as in the analysis of single molecules or nanomaterials. On the other hand, AFM-Raman systems with spectral resolution of ≤1 cm-1 are more commonly used in routine analytical applications where slightly lower resolution is acceptable, but still provide valuable data on the chemical composition and structure of samples. Both types of systems offer high sensitivity and spatial resolution for comprehensive sample analysis.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Battery Laminated Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Process</li><li>Dry Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Battery laminated film market can be classified into two types: thermal process and dry process. In the thermal process, the film is heated and pressed onto the battery cell to create a strong bond. This method is commonly used for high-energy density batteries. On the other hand, the dry process involves the use of adhesives or pressure-sensitive films to laminate the battery cell. This method is preferred for cost-effective and environmentally friendly production processes. Both processes have their own advantages and are used based on specific requirements of the battery manufacturer.</p></p>

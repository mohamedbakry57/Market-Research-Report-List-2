<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultra-thin FPC Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-sided</li><li>Double-sided</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ultra-thin Flexible Printed Circuits (FPC) are available in two main types: single-sided and double-sided. Single-sided FPCs have circuits and components on only one side of the flexible substrate, making them thinner and lighter than traditional rigid PCBs. They are suitable for simple electronic devices with limited space. Double-sided FPCs have circuits on both sides of the substrate, allowing for more complex designs and higher component density. They are commonly used in more advanced electronics that require more functionality in a compact form factor.</p></p>
